#### To create a type script app with react use:
    ```npx create-react-app react-typescript-demo --template typescript```

* unlike a regular react app, you have the extension as .tsx    
* Components are defined in .tsx files
* when you hover in the function of App component you can see it returns a jsx element, which is actually type inference

##### use types when building apps and interface when building libraries
* type for a react component passed as a child prop will be React.ReactNode as shown in Oscar.tsx
